When you die, ain't nobody gonna remember you
If you don't know me by now, I don't want you to
None of your favorite rappers ever tell the truth
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, out of my mind
It's about damn time y'all startin' to die
Lay low, I'm the ghost at your window
Went away, now I'm way away, there he go
